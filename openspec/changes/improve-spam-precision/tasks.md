## 1. Implementation
- [ ] Sweep eval thresholds (0.40–0.55) with class_weight=balanced, ngram_range=(1,2), min_df ∈ {2,3}.
- [ ] If needed, try ngram_range=(1,1) and tune C ∈ {0.5, 1.0, 2.0}.
- [ ] Choose config achieving Precision ≥ 0.90 with Recall ≥ 0.93 and record commands.

## 2. Validation
- [ ] Confirm targets on held-out split and update README with the recommended settings.
